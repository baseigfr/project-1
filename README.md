# JavaScript Aim Trainer
By: Beau Seigfreid

This is a game I made with jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS


## Files
README.md  
app.js  
index.html  
style.css  


## Installing The Game

You can play the full game by going to https://baseigfr.github.io/project-1/
Alternatively you can download the files into a directory and start the index.html file.

## How to Play

The game goes through 2 iterations of 30 second game time. Click Start Game and you'll see a dot on the screen.
Simply click the dots to acquire points as they come up. The round will end in 30 seconds and a new round will begin. The second round you track and click a rectangle as best you can. Then the game ends with your points tallied up and you can choose to play again or close out of the game. 

## Technologies

The game is made mostly with JavaScript and jQuery. I made the background with photoshop, uploaded it to imgur, and plugged it in with some CSS. HTML holds the whole thing together. 

## Unsolved Problems

The game currently runs fine as is with little bugs. It has some room to improve between rounds where there should be a hard reset period and you can't click anything. 

## Forthcoming Features

The code is written in such a way that it repeats itself unfortunately and now that I understand function calls a little better I would make it so the functions don't repeat themselves as much. This is something that grows with coding, I feel.
